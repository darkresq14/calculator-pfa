## PFA Salary Calculator

This calculator is designed to help you estimate the brutto hourly salary you should ask for in order to achieve your desired netto monthly income as a PFA (Persoană Fizică Autorizată) in Romania. It takes into consideration multiple taxes and duties, including income tax, CAS (Social Insurance), CASS (Health Insurance), and FNUASS (medical leave for PFA). By providing your desired netto monthly income, the calculator will generate an estimate of the brutto hourly salary you should aim for. This can be a useful tool for individuals who are self-employed or considering becoming a PFA in Romania.

Please note that this calculator provides an estimate and should not be considered as financial or legal advice. It’s always recommended to consult with a qualified professional for personalized guidance regarding your specific situation.
